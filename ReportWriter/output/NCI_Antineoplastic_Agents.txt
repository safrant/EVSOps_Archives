ADH-1 selectively and competitively binds to and blocks N-cadherin, which may result in disruption of tumor vasculature, inhibition of tumor cell growth, and the induction of tumor cell and endothelial cell apoptosis. N-cadherin, a cell- surface transmembrane glycoprotein of the cadherin superfamily of proteins involved in calcium-mediated cell-cell adhesion and signaling mechanisms; may be upregulated in some aggressive tumors and the endothelial cells and pericytes of some tumor blood vessels.$ADH-1|Exherin$NCI Use_for not found$$$
C48370$NCI PT not found$A synthetic lysyl prodrug of the amino-substituted flavone derivate aminoflavone with antiproliferative and antineoplastic activities. AFP464 is rapidly converted to aminoflavone in plasma. Aminoflavone activates the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signaling pathway leading to an increase in cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) expression and, to a lesser extent, an increase in cytochrome P450 1B1 (CYP1B1) expression. Subsequently, aminoflavone is metabolized to toxic metabolites by the cytochromome P450 enzymes that it induces; these toxic metabolites covalently bind to DNA, resulting in the phosphorylation of p53, the induction of the p53 downstream target p21Waf1/Cip1, and apoptosis. Pulmonary toxicity may be dose-limiting.$AFP464$NCI Use_for not found$$$

ATN-224 selectively chelates the copper ion in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) in endothelial cells, thereby depleting SOD1 of copper and inhibiting its activity. Inhibition of SOD1 interferes with the activation of several signal transduction pathways required for cellular proliferation and angiogenesis, including those mediated by ERK1/2 and FAK and Src kinases. This results in an inhibition of cell proliferation and angiogenesis as well as induction of apoptosis.$ATN-224|Bis(choline)tetrathiomolybdate|Ethanaminium, 2-Hydroxy-N,N,N-Trimethyl-, (T-4)-Tetrathioxomolybdate(2-) (2:1)|SOD1 Inhibitor ATN-224$NCI Use_for not found$$$
C88296$NCI PT not found$A soluble fusion protein containing the extracellular domain of activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ALK1) fused to a human Fc domain (ALK1-Fc fusion protein), with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Upon administration, dalantercept binds to various ALK1 ligands, preventing activation of tumor cell ALK1 receptors and so inhibiting the ALK1 signaling pathway; growth factor-induced angiogenesis is thus inhibited, which may result in the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and tumor cell death. ALK1 is a type I cell surface receptor with serine/threonine kinase activity that mediates signaling by members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) superfamily and plays a key role in angiogenesis; ligands for this receptor include TGFbeta1 and TGFbeta2. The Fc moiety of this fusion protein mediates clearance of ligand-fusion protein complexes by the reticuloendothelial system (RES).$ACE-041|ALK1-Fc Fusion Protein ACE-041|Activin Receptor-like Kinase 1 Inhibitor ACE-041|Dalantercept$NCI Use_for not found$$$

ARQ 171 induces the expression of E2F transcription factor 1, thereby activating the E2F1-mediated checkpoint process. E2F1, down-regulated in cancer cells, regulates expression of genes involved in the cell cycle progression from G1 into S phase. The G1/S checkpoint process selectively induces cell cycle arrest in cancer cells with irreparable DNA damages and triggers subsequent apoptosis, while allowing cell division to proceed in cells without or with minor reparable DNA damage.

C71537$NCI PT not found$A 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide (AICA) riboside, a ribnucleoside analog, and a nucleotide biosynthesis precursor with B cell pro-apoptotic activity. Following cellular uptake, acadesine is phosphorylated to AICA ribotide (ZMP), which mimics 5'-adenosine monophosphate (AMP). Both AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AMPK kinase (AMPKK) are activated by ZMP, which appears to be necessary for the induction of apoptosis. Acadesine-induced apoptosis also appears to require cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase activation and is p53-independent. However, the exact mechanism of acadesine-induced apoptosis is unknown. T cells are significantly less susceptible than B cells to acadesine-induced apoptosis.

ARQ 761 is converted to beta-lapachone (b-lap) in vivo. When b-lap is activated by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1) this agent creates a futile oxidoreduction, generating highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) that results in DNA damage. The activation of b-lap also causes hyperactivation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), an enzyme that facilitates DNA repair, accompanied by rapid depletion of NAD+/ATP nucleotide levels. As a result, a caspase-independent and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced mu-calpain-mediated cell death occurs in NQO1-overexpressing tumor cells. In addition, b-lap induces expression of the checkpoints activator E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and thereby activates the E2F1-mediated checkpoint pathway that directly triggers apoptosis.

This leads to an inhibition of migration of leukocytes and other inflammatory cells, thereby reducing the inflammatory response to deposited urate crystals.  Colchicine may also interrupt the cycle of monosodium urate crystal deposition in joint tissues, thereby also preventing the resultant inflammatory response. Overall, colchicine decreases leukocyte chemotaxis/migration and phagocytosis to inflamed areas, and inhibits the formation and release of a chemotactic glycoprotein that is produced during phagocytosis of urate crystals.$(S)-N-(5,6,7,9-Tetrahydro-1,2,3,10-tetramethoxy-9-oxobenzo[a]heptalen-7-yl)acetamide|Colchicine$NCI Use_for not found$$$

Altogether, this may result in the inhibition of tumor cell growth. Further, this agent prevents free radical formation and inhibits lipid peroxidation. Tocotrienols contain 3 double bonds, absent in tocopherols, on its farnesyl isoprenoid side chain that likely contribute to its anti-cancer activities.$GDT|Gamma-delta Tocotrienol|gdT3$NCI Use_for not found$$$

Endothelial cell-specific transcriptional control of the adenoviral vector is achieved by the use of a modified murine PPE-1 promoter that is specifically activated in PPE-1-expressing angiogenic endothelial cells residing in the tumor microvasculature. Subsequently, the Fas-c (Fas-chimeric) death receptor, containing Fas and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor 1 (TNFR1) moieties, is expressed in angiogenic endothelial cells; endothelial cell-specific Fas-mediated apoptosis is initiated by the binding of TNF-alpha, abundant in the tumor microenvironment, to the TNFR1 moiety of the expressed Fas-c death receptor.$Angiogenesis Inhibitor GT-111|GT-111$NCI Use_for not found$$$
C102856$NCI PT not found$An orally available valproic acid prodrug of gemcitabine, a broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine prodrug LY2334737 is hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase 2 (CES2) and releases gemcitabine systemically over a period of time consistent with formation rate-limited kinetics. In turn, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate and triphosphate (dFdCDP and dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA replication; dFdCTP is incorporated into DNA, resulting in premature termination of DNA replication and eventually the induction of apoptosis. Compared to gemcitabine, this prodrug is able to avoid hydrolysis in enterocytes and the portal circulation thus avoiding first pass metabolism and increasing systemic gemcitabine availability. In addition, the slow release of gemcitabine may enhance efficacy while lowering toxicity. CES2, a serine ester hydrolase, is expressed in certain tumors which may allow for increased conversion of gemcitabine at the tumor site thus increases cytotoxicity.$Gemcitabine Prodrug LY2334737|LY2334737$NCI Use_for not found$$$

With the phosphoramidate moiety on the gemcitabine monophosphate group, NUC-1031 has improved properties over its parent molecule: 1) is more lipophilic and accumulates in cancer cells by passive diffusion and does not require a nucleoside transporter, 2) as the agent is delivered in the monophosphate form, the first phosphorylation step by deoxycytidine kinase is not required, 3) this agent is not susceptible to deactivation by cytidine deaminase cleavage of the monophosphorylated form.

C67477$NCI PT not found$Any of a class of anti-mitotic compounds that bind to the maytansine site of the beta tubulin subunit, a region that appears to overlap, at least partially, with the vinca-binding site. Compared to the vinca-site binding agents, these ligands have distinctly different chemical structures, resulting in unique interactions with the sulfhydryl residues, and perhaps with other structures on the tubulin protein, thereby producing different physiological effects which do not fully mimic those of the vinca-site ligands. Like the vinca-site agents, these compounds inhibit the polymerization of tubulin dimers and thereby, prevent the assembly of microtubules. The subsequent decrease in the amount of formed microtubules causes disassembly of the mitotic spindle resulting from instability of the structure during the mitotic interphase, eventually leading to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis.$Maytansine-Site Binding Agent|Rhizoxin-Site Binding Agent$NCI Use_for not found$$$

C1340$NCI PT not found$A semisynthetic derivative of the antineoplastic anthracycline antibiotic doxorubicin. With a mechanism of action that appears to differ from doxorubicin, valrubicin is converted intracytoplasmically into N-trifluoroacetyladriamycin, which interacts with topoisomerase II, stabilizing the complex between the enzyme and DNA; consequently, DNA replication and repair and RNA and protein synthesis are inhibited and the cell cycle is arrested in the G2 phase.

Valrubicin is less cardiotoxic than doxorubicin when administered systemically; applied topically, this agent shows excellent tissue penetration. Structurally, the trifluoro-acetyl moiety on the amino group of the glycoside and the valerate moiety appear to result in a lipophilicity that is greater than of doxorubicin, resulting in increased intracytoplasmic concentrations.$AD 32|AD-32|N-Trifluoroacetyladriamycin-14-valerate|Valrubicin|Valstar|Valtaxin$NCI Use_for not found$$$

C104280$NCI PT not found$An orally bioavailable HDM2 (human homolog of double minute 2) antagonist with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral administration, p53/HDM2 interaction inhibitor CGM097 inhibits the binding of the HDM2 protein to the transcriptional activation domain of the tumor suppressor protein p53. By preventing this HDM2-p53 interaction, the proteosome-mediated enzymatic degradation of p53 is inhibited, which may result in the restoration of p53 signaling and, thus, the p53-mediated induction of tumor cell apoptosis. HDM2, a zinc finger nuclear phosphoprotein, is a negative regulator of the p53 pathway, often overexpressed in cancer cells and has been implicated in cancer cell proliferation and survival.$CGM097|HDM2/p53 Inhibitor CGM097|p53/HDM2 Interaction Inhibitor CGM097$NCI Use_for not found$$$
C99639$NCI PT not found$A proprietary RNA interference construct consisting of bifunctional short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) against human stathmin 1 (STMN1) encapsulated in the cationic bilamellar invaginated vesicle lipoplex (LP) with potential antineoplastic activity. pbi-shRNA STMN1 LP contains 2 stem-loop structures encoded by a plasmid vector. Upon intratumoral administration, one shRNA unit with a perfectly matched sequence renders the suppression of STMN1 mRNA translation (mRNA sequestration and cleavage-independent degradation) while the other unit with an imperfectly matched sequence renders STMN1 mRNA degradation via RNase H-like cleavage (cleavage-dependent mRNA silencing). The suppression of STMN1 expression in tumor cells result in a reduction of tumor cell proliferation. STMN1, a ubiquitous cytosolic phosphoprotein and tubulin modulator that plays a key role in mitosis, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors and correlates with poor prognosis.$pbi-shRNA STMN1 LP|pbi-shRNA STMN1 Lipoplex$NCI Use_for not found$$$
C95772$NCI PT not found$A proprietary, miniature biodegradable polymeric matrix containing small-interfering RNAs for the mutated KRAS oncogene, KRASG12D, (siG12D), with potential antitumor activity. Upon intratumoral injection, this siG12D is released locally, thereby preventing translation of KRAS proteins and potentially inhibiting growth of tumor cells overexpressing KRAS. KRAS, a member of the small GTPase superfamily, is mutated in over 90% of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) and is associated with tumor cell proliferation and reduced survival.$siG12D LODER$NCI Use_for not found$$$
C28788$NCI PT not found$A purine analogue with potential antineoplastic activity.  8-Azaguanine interferes with the modification of transfer ribonucleic acid (tRNA) by competing with guanine for incorporation into tRNA catalyzed by the enzyme tRNA-guanine ribosyltransferase (tRNA-guanine transglycosylase).  Altered guanine modification of tRNA has been implicated in cellular differentiation and neoplastic transformation.  8-Azaguanine also inhibits the formation of 43S and 80S initiation complexes, thereby interfering with initiation of translation and inhibiting protein synthesis.  This agent inhibits tumor cell growth and stimulates cell differentiation.

C28694$NCI PT not found$A poorly soluble, ortho-naphthoquinone with potential antineoplastic and radiosensitizing activity. Beta-lapachone (b-lap) is bioactivated by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1), creating a futile oxidoreduction that generates high levels of superoxide. In turn, the highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) interact with DNA, thereby causing single-strand DNA breaks and calcium release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. Eventually, the extensive DNA damage causes hyperactivation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), an enzyme facilitating DNA repair, accompanied by rapid depletion of NAD+/ATP nucleotide levels. As a result, a caspase-independent and ER-stress induced mu-calpain-mediated cell death occurs in NQO1-overexpressing tumor cells. NQO1, a flavoprotein and two-electron oxidoreductase, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors.$3,4-Dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphtho(1,2-b)pyran-5,6-dione|ARQ 501|ARQ501|Beta-Lap-WJ|Beta-Lapachone|Lapachone$NCI Use_for not found$$$
C85465$NCI PT not found$A quinuclidinone derivative that targets the Wrap53 gene with potential antineoplastic activity. p53 activator APR-246 binds to and activates transcription of the Wrap53 gene, which results in an increase in WRAP53 p53 antisense transcript levels and, potentially, an increase in native p53 activity; in turn, increased p53 activity may lead to an induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells. This agent may work synergistically with other antineoplastic agents. p53, a tumor suppressor and transcription factor normally activated upon DNA damage, is mutated or absent in various cancer cell types and plays a key role in DNA repair and the induction of apoptosis. The Wrap53 transcript, a natural p53 antisense transcript, regulates endogenous p53 mRNA levels and additional induction of p53 protein by targeting the 5' untranslated region of p53 mRNA.$APR-246|PRIMA-1MET|p53 Activator APR-246$NCI Use_for not found$$$
